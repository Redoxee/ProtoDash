Dasher
[Image - Title]

Dasher is a platformer for mobile phone.

It takes its inspiration from games such as Super Meat Boy, N, and Tower Fall.

The core of the game revolves around completing fairly short levels in the least amount of time possible.

To do so the player can jump, wall jump, and dash through the air. One key component of the game is the control scheme, which avoids the use of a virtual button, instead using a combination of tap and swipe.

The Key points I want in the game are:
- The dash
- The smoothness (I would like my game to run at 60 fps on as many mobile phones as possible)
- The flow and the simplicity of the controls

here is a HTML5 Version

Please feel free to try it and tell me what you think about it.
Also if you're brave enough to install an application from a stranger there is a link to the apk file


To do:
- Display the time limit
- Add a mechanic of Par time (like in SMB I would like to unlock a hard mode for each level if you're fast enough)
- Implement some kind of replay at the end of a level
- Add some transitions when the player dies or finishes a level
- A ton more levels. I would really like to have 100+ levels but I'm no level designer
- Add some nice transitions between the menus
- Rework the controls so they behave better when the player touches the screen with multiple fingers
- Add a settings menu
- Find a business model (right now I feel like making a demo and then going premium but I'm not sure)
- Add some SFX
- Add some music ? (not sure)
- Redo the colors
- Add some VFX (particles, trail)
- Add some background effects
- Overall making the game more visually interesting while keeping it simple (I'm not an artist and I want to use as few textures as possible anyway)

About me:
I'm Anton and I'm making this game mostly by myself using Unity. It is the first time I've worked this long on one of my own games and I would like to go all the way to release with this one.
This is my first devlog also. I hope it'll help me stay focused and motivate me to finish the game.
I look forward to having some feedback, especially on the colors, as I'm color blind, and I have terrible taste when it comes to colors. There is too much information to display for me to go black and white on this project.

Dasher
[Image - Title]

Dasher is a platformer for mobile phone.

It takes its inspirations from games such as Super Meat Boy, N and Tower Fall.

The core of the game revolve around completing fairly short levels in the less amount of time possible.

To do so the player can jump, wall jump and dash through the air. One key component of the game is the control scheme witch avoid the use of virtual button for a combination of tap and swipe.

The Key points I want in the game:
- The dash
- The smoothness (I would like my game to run at 60 fps on as much mobile phone as possible)
- The flow and the simplicity of the controls

here is a HTML5 Version

To do:
- Display the time of the level
- Add a mechanic of Par time (like in smb I would like to unlock hard mode for each level if you're fast enought)
- Implement some kind of replay at the end of a level
- Add some transition when the player die or finish a level
- A tone more level. I would really like 100+ levels but I'm no Level designer
- Add some nice transition betweens the menus
- Reworks the controls so they behave better when the player touche the screen with multiple fingers
- Add some settings menus
- find a business model (right now I feel like a demo and then go premium but I'm not sure)
- Add some sfx
- Add some music ? (not sure)
- Redo the colors
- Add some VFX (particles, trail)
- Overall making the game more visually interesting while keeping it simple (I'm not an artist and I want to use ase few texture as possible anyway)
- Add some background effect

About me:
Hey ! I'm Anton and I'm making this game mostly by myself using Unity. It is the first time I've worked this long on one of my personal games and I would like to go all the way to the release.
This is the first time I do a dev log and I hope it'll help me stay focus and motivate me to finish the project.
I look forward to have some feedback, especially on the colors, I'm color blind plus I have terrible taste when it comes to colors. There are to much information to display for me to go black and white on this project.
